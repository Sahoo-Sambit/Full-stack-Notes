What is internet?
-> Interconnected Networks
-> Network of Networks

History of Internet :
1960 : ARPANET
1980 : DNS / WWW
1990 : email / message / shopping
2000 : FB / GOOGLE
Today : AI / Data scrapping, analysis, streaming, uploads,etc.

ISP : A medium used to access internet. Rental monthly charges by provider to provide server IP address.
Packets : A huge file is break into small chunks of data so, that it can be transferred through internet from client to server or viceversa

Protocols : Set of rules.

4 layers of network :
Client                   requests           Server
1. Application layer   <--XYZ app           1. Application layer
2. TCP                 <--Port No.          2. TCP
3. IP                  <--IP address        3. IP
4. Hardware  --------->Internet -------->   4. Hardware


client --> requests through router(connects multiple devices) ---> ISP ---> Searches IP address.

How packets travel over internet ? 
Client -> Requests -> Local ISP -> If found, fetches data from user else -> Regional ISP -> If found, fetches data from user else ->
National Service Provider -> Router -> Multiple Routers associated -> Server 

Basically, it's a request made by client through router who helps in finding the destination IP address.
Router contains routing table which searches for IP address if not found, router sends requests to parent router and similarly goes on till server' IP address.

Protocols : HTTP, FTP, SMTP

IP address as IPv4 : Internet Protocol version 4. underlying technology that makes it possible for us to connect our devices to the web.
32 bit IP address length.
IP address as IPv6 : Internet Protocol version 6. underlying technology that makes it possible for us to connect our devices to the web.
128 bit IP address length.
